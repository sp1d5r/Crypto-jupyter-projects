# Cryptography Projects

This repository is the result of the following conversation I had with myself. 

--------------------------------
I want to get into cryptography. 

Okay, simple enough...

Where do I start?

----------------


## Road Map
I found a [website](https://cryptopals.com/), which is supposed to give me a 
few good cryptography challenges. I'll complete each one in a jupyter notebook
I'll conclude each challenge with things I learnt from it. There are 8 "sets",
I'll include a contents page, and you can check the relevant jupyter notebooks 
for it.


* Beginner - [Notebook Folder](notebooks/Beginner%20Projects) -  [Notes Folder](Notes%20/Beginner)
    * Converting Hex and Base 64 - [Notes](Notes%20/Beginner/Convertin%20Hex%20and%20Base%2064/README.md)
