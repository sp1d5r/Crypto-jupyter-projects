    "Hex is a base 16 character set It goes from 0-9, A-F. Where A=11, B=11, ..., F=16. This is useful since each hex character is 4 bits (nibble). We write hex characters with an 0x at the start, so 0x0, is 0 in hex. Below is the table of conversions:\n",

    "Base 64, is the binary to text encoding system that lets you convert binary into an ASCII format. It takes in binary values and outputs characters between A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +,/, It really shines when converting ASCII text. \n",

To fix this we included an additional if statement at the start. Overall the time complexity for this function is O(n) (given a hex length n/4) since it iterates through the binary version of that hex representation. \n",
